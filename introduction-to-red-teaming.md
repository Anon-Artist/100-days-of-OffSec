# Introduction to Red Teaming

### What is Red Teaming

In fact there is no proper definition is available for Red teaming for example Red teaming is often used interchangeably with penetration testing even there is key difference in between them.\
As I said the term is not standardized but in some reference the term Red Teaming is defined as the process of using Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to emulate a real-world threat with the goals of training and measuring the effectiveness of the people, processes, and technology used to defend an environment or it is the practice of looking at a problem or situation from the perspective of an adversary.

### Why Red Teaming

Red Teaming can be used to:

1. Measure the effectiveness of the people, processes, and technology used to defend a network.
2. Train and/or measure Blue teams ability to impact a threat.
3. Test and understand specific threats or threat scenarios Red team engagements can be designed to exercise custom scenarios. Scenarios can include zero-days, ransom-ware attacks, or other unique attacks.

### Red Teaming x Penetration Testing

Some of the key difference between Red Teaming and Penetration testing are:

| Red Teaming                                                      | Penetration Testing                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focused on achieving goals or an attack path to achieve the goal | Focused on Identifying maximum number of vulnerabilities |
| Assess people, processes and technologies                        | Assess vulnerabilities in the specified scope            |
| Broad Scope                                                      | Pre-Defined Scope                                        |
| Focus on stealth                                                 | Stealth is not a factor                                  |

### Red Team Methodologies

One of the famous and most used framework is "Cyber Kill Chain" developed by Lockheed Martin.

There are other methodologies and framework such as

1. MITRE ATT & CK \[[https://attack.mitre.org/](https://attack.mitre.org/)]
2. CBEST Intelligence Led Testing \[[https://www.crest-approved.org/membership/cbest/](https://www.crest-approved.org/membership/cbest/)]
3. Adversarial Attack Simulation Exercise \[[https://abs.org.sg/docs/library/abs-red-team-adversarial-attack-simulation-exercises-guidelines-v1-06766a69f299c69658b7dff00006ed795.pdf](https://abs.org.sg/docs/library/abs-red-team-adversarial-attack-simulation-exercises-guidelines-v1-06766a69f299c69658b7dff00006ed795.pdf)]
