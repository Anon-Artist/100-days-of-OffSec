# External Reconnaissance

External reconnaissance is an essential phase in red teaming, which involves gathering information and assessing the security posture of a target organization from an external perspective. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential attack vectors that an adversary might exploit.

Every time start with passive reconnaissance and if needed use active reconnaissance.

### Passive Reconnaissance

Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target systems or network. It typically relies on publicly available information and does not involve any intrusive actions

### Active Reconnaissance

Active reconnaissance involves more direct interaction with the target systems or network to gather information. This approach typically involves probing, scanning, or interacting with the target in various ways to identify potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or attack vectors.
