# Introduction to Red Team Infrastructure

### What is Command and Control (C2)

In the context of a red team, "C2" stands for Command and Control. C2 refers to the mechanisms or infrastructure that the red team uses to control and coordinate its activities. This can include communication channels, tools, and technologies that allow the red team members to collaborate, share information, and execute their tactics.
